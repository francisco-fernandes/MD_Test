* Stats for non-bonded distances:
	- check closest atom that is not connected, and add distance to paired-distances array
	- consider atom sub-type (based on which other elements it is bonded to)
	- create image with histogram of distances (per element and also per sub-type)
	- use accellerating structure for nearest-neighbours queries?

* Test all possible rotations for all 3x3x3 voxel shapes
	- group by number of set voxels
	- devise way to rotate shape bits
	- compare against already stored
	- count all different combinations
