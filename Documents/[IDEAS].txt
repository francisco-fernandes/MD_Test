[Molecular Dynamics]

- at spaced intervals (of the size of a water molecule radius), place fake atoms representing water molecules
	at the grid points near the surface of the molecule
	test the force of those fake molecules

- test quadratic decrease of force decay instead of linear

- lookup table for distances (square root) calculation

- grid of "distance steps" instead of linear steps (aproximate sphere by a cube)

- test per-axis-pair linked-list with cumulative sum of distances per element to current atom
	on next atom, simply add/subtract distances off atoms behind/ahead from prev atom to current atom
	for each atom type keep cumulative distances to each of the simulation box's corners
	find formula to approximate triangular inequality using those corner distances

- use "double buffering" for atoms positions (and for force field too):
	one for current position, other for next position
	move the atom half-way distance (minus delta) between its position and the closest atom in that direction
	plus extra step to fix incoherent atoms positions (based on bond lengths limits)
 
- use octree but with (8?) overlapping extra levels
	update all overlapping levels when going bottom-top
	this is to prevent "close to octree level boundary" errors
	consider "distance to center of cube" and store weighted value
	optimize with pre-computed distance-to-center-of-cube table

- calculate/update system global energy in time intervals by processing one atom/residue for each frame

- get histograms of bond distances in steps of 0.1 (?) Angstroms for each atom of each residue
	get average/min/max lengths
	create image for that (?)

- get histograms (per element) of outer non-bonded atom distances around current atom

- get average (mode?) relative positions of all atoms inside each residue
	to allow to add missing hydrogens or other atoms
	and to enable to load a protein by "creating" it one aminoacid at a time

- from other folding experiments, get approximate values for nanoseconds time and for potential energy

- presentation: choose molecule do fold (?), run it on a few state-of-the-art MD tools, run it on ours

- names: nanoMD , ProteinDebugger



[Protein Shape+Force Volume/Space Tree Index]

- count all different 3x3x3 shapes rotated and aligned

- iteratively test several grid sizes and check which one the complementary shapes fit best

- for force field score: instead of only one electrostatic energy value, store one negative value and one positive value
	for instance to account hydrogen bonding
	draw color as (x,y) of (black, red/blue, purple)

- try: instead of regular SAS, don't considered sidechains (on the outside) to calculate protein surface (only backchain atoms)
	because the surface gets less "bumpy"
	test drawing backbone with VdW spheres and sidechains with bond lines only
	or try replacing with sphere with average radius of that residue type



[Visualization]

- full semi-transparent force-field (blue to white/transparent/zero to red)
	option to increase/decrease transparency intensity (or min/max threshold to draw) to view stronger regions
	also allow viewing by X, Y or Z slices

- draw order by sorting by distance (or only diferences) to center of axis (i.e. minimum coordinates values)
